Description:

In this project, I've recreated the visual essence of Spotify's web interface using pure HTML and CSS, demonstrating my skills in crafting engaging and responsive user experiences. While this front-end doesn't incorporate actual audio playback, it lays a solid foundation for exploring front-end development principles.

Key Features:

Pitch-Perfect Design: Precise replication of Spotify's layout, typography, color scheme, and iconography for a visually authentic experience.
Responsive Harmony: Seamless adaptation to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and navigation across devices.
Structural Integrity: Strategic use of HTML5 elements to establish a well-organized and accessible page structure.
Visual Flair: CSS mastery in styling elements, creating hover effects, and positioning content for visual appeal.
Technologies Used:

HTML5
CSS3
